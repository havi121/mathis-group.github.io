# About the name

The Mathis Group aims to conduct high quality, reproducible, interdisciplinary research. Research of this nature requires a team with a diverse skillset, and with diverse backgrounds â€” the most interesting questions cannot be answered by a single mind. The name of 'Mathis-Group' is not intended imply the PI the only intellectual contributor to the team's success. The name was chosen because it is simple, and unambiguously ties the entire team to the most persistent individual in the group. PI Cole Mathis bears all the responsibility (but not all the credit) for the team's success. The simplicity of the name is important considering the ever-growing Arizona State University ecosystem, particularly the Biodesign Institute, and the School of Complex Adaptive Systems, which have their own idiosyncratic naming conventions.
