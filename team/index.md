# About the name

The Mathis Group aims to conduct high quality, reproducible, interdisciplinary research. Research of this nature requires a team with a diverse skill set, and with diverse backgrounds â€” the most interesting questions cannot be answered by a single mind. The name 'Mathis-Group' does not imply the PI is the only intellectual contributor to the team's success. The name was chosen because it is simple, and unambiguously locates the entire team with the most persistent individual in the group. This is important considering the ever-shifting Arizona State University ecosystem, including the Biodesign Institute, and the School of Complex Adaptive Systems, which have their own idiosyncratic naming conventions.
