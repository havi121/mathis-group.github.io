I'm a scientist who's passionate about understanding the origins of life.

I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Complex Adaptive Systems and the Biodesign Center for Biocomputation, Security, and Society at Arizona State University.

Before starting the Mathis-Group, I was a Research Lab Coordinator in the Beyond Center at Arizona State University, working with Professor Sara Walker and the ELife Lab.Previously I was a NASA Astrobiology Fellow focused on on Agnostic Biosignatures and Life Detection. Prior to that I was a post doctoral researcher and Team Leader at the University of Glasgow, working in the artificial life team of Professor Lee Cronin's lab.

I have a PhD in Physics from Arizona State University. My disseration "On the Origin of the Living State," was done under the supervision of Professor Sara Walker. I also have an undergraduate degree in Physics from San Francisco State University.
