Hi! I joined the Mathis Group in Fall 2024. Within the group, my research interests include astrobiology, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and assembly theory. I also work in the Buseck Center for Meteorite Studies as a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Rhonda Stroud. I spent time at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) working in support of the OSIRIS-REx mission and studying methods for measuring contamination in curatorial facilities. After completing my masterâ€™s degree in Analytical Planetary Chemistry at Okayama University, I performed initial curatorial analysis for the Hayabusa2 mission. 

I am training on Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) combined with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) on TEM/STEM Nion Monochromate UltraSTEM 100.

I have been trained to work with an Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Fusion) and GC-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific TRACE 1310 with various quadrapole setups).
