I am a physicist with dual training in philosophy, deeply passionate about the origins of life and complex systems. I’m currently completing my Ph.D. in physics at the Université de Montréal.

I have worked on several models and theories of complexity derived from statistical physics, including network theory and self-organized criticality. I have also investigated how various physical phenomena, such as perturbations or diffusion, influence the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary environments, and am also interested in recent applications of frameworks such as assembly theory and information theory to the origins of life. In addition to my research work, I am also involved in the Origin of Life Early Career Network and publish the Origin of Life Digest.

I will be joining the Mathis-Group for the Fall 2024 semester to focus on numerical modelling of spatially embedded chemical reaction networks.
