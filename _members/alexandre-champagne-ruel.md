I’m Alexandre Champagne-Ruel, a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow with the Mathis Group at ASU. I’m a physicist with dual training in philosophy, and I’m deeply passionate about the origins of life and complex systems.

I study how physical processes and environmental structures shape the emergence of complexity at life’s origin. Using artificial-chemistry models, I investigate how transport and topology modulate the emergence of complex chemistry, with the goal of refining agnostic life-detection strategies and experimental design.

In earlier work, I explored how perturbations and diffusion can promote cooperative phenomena, complex behavior, and spatial patterning. I’m also actively involved in the Origin of Life Early Career Network and maintain the Origin of Life Digest.
